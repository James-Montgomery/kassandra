## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Installation guid coming soon.

### Examples

I've included basic examples of how to use squidward to get new users started building gaussian process models with this package.

Many of these examples include visualizations of data and GP models. Running these examples locally will require the visualization packages below:

~~~Bash
pip install "matplotlib>=2.2.3" "seaborn>=0.9.0"
~~~

Examples and Tutorials can be found on the kassandra [docs site](https://james-montgomery.github.io/kassandra/).

### Advice for Getting Better Results

1. scale your inputs
2. center your inputs

## Testing

Testing is an important part of creating maintainable, production grade code. Below are instructions for running unit and style tests as well as installing the necessary testing packages. Tests have intentionally been separated from the installable pypi package for a variety of reasons.

### Running the unit tests

Tests coming soon.

### Running the style tests

Tests coming soon.

## Acknowledgments

A big thank you to Josh Touyz who first introduced me to the world of deep learning oh so long ago. Thank you as well to Keegan Hines who introduced me to the concept of Bayesian deep learning. Finally, thanks to Jason Wittenbach and Bayan Bruss who I have had endless conversations with on the subject of bayesian neural networks.
